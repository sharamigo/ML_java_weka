# Exercise 6: Unit-Testing


The goal of this exercise is to implement units tests for our upcoming implementation of a decision tree algorithm.

## Step 1
Please `clone` the repository `https://github.com/idh-cologne-machine-learning-mit-java/exercise-06`.

Create a new branch, using your UzK username.

## Step 2
The `pom.xml` file already contains the necessary dependencies.

You'll find the code framework we developed during the exercise in the 
respective files. Please add a unit test for each class, and one or more tests
for each method. 

The unit test code is stored in `src/test/java`, using the same package structure 
as the regular code. Make sure that your code compiles and runs, by either 
entering `mvn test` on the command line or via the GUI of your IDE. Be aware 
that all tests are expected to *fail*, as we haven't written any code yet. If a 
test does not fail, verify that it actually tests something.

## Step 3
Commit your changes and push them to the server.
